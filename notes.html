<!-- *******IT'S ALL ABOUT COMPONENTS, STATES AND PROPS, and remember that a render can only essentially display 1 parent element, if we want to render multiple parent elements, they have to be wrapped in a div. Remember to use ".bind(this)" when passing functions or methods around. Whenever we're binding a value, we'll also set up a change listener for that, so that it actually changes when the value changes. Also, css-like design elements with hyphens are camelCase in React JSX and should be made into a component, and then implemented, in order for them to function.*******
******FLUX is a pattern. CADS, Components, Actions, Dispatcher, Stores and it cycles again.******
***Excerpt of advice from YouTube: The easiest way to set up your project is to make a directory tree structure the way it's displayed on his sublime text editor.  If you can't make out the structure, do this:  create your project folder; inside the project folder create a 'src' folder; inside the 'src' folder, create a 'js' folder.  You will now create four files.  Create two empty files,  'package.json' and a 'webpack.config.js', and place them at the top level of your project folder.  Create another empty file, 'index.html'  and put it inside your 'src' folder.   Create the last file, 'client.js' and place it inside 'js' folder.

Now advance the video to 3:04 and simply type what you see into your 'client.js' file.  As for the contents of the other three files, you can go to the github repository he listed in the  comments under the video.  Specifically, you will need to access the '1-basic-react' folder to get the contents of each the other three files.  

After you have set up your folders and copied the files, you run 'npm install', then 'webpack',  and the rest of the folders and files will be automatically installed.  At this point you can advance to '2:38' in  the video and continue following along.  Hope this helps you and anyone else who might have the same question.﻿***-->

<!-- before, when i ran "npm install", then "webpack", it said "bash webpack command not found" I realized that I had to first "npm install webpack" first, and then run "webpack" and this seemed to work-->
<!-- one more detail, npm install webpack-dev-server lets you live re-load-->

<!-- i might've figured out why it wasn't working up to this point, I forgot to npm install flux   !! -->
